                            from bean to brew - in every shipment.</p>

                    <h3>Our commitment</h3>
                    <p>We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to make it
                        easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source.
                        To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to
                        understand the challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with
                        exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community of farmers through with well above
                        fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training, support farm community initiatives, and invest in
                        coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting
                        profiles distinctive to their native growing region.</p>

                    <h3>Uncompromising quality</h3>
                    <p>Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and processing, we
                        employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the
                        coffee
                        dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast
                        consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
